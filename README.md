# Web_Scraping

This is the project that I use for web scraping. I used beautiful soup 4 with Python 3. Each function has their own utilities, and one can use for reference as each website has their own unqiue html structure. 

This example shows how to iterate all the links'contents if the original link is given. Thus one does not need to copy all the links into the input.
